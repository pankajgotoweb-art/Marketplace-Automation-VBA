# Excel VBA Automation Projects (Old Portfolio Work)

This repo contains two of my older Excel VBA automation tools that I built while working on eCommerce data operations.  
These files were created years ago, back when Internet Explorer automation was still commonly used.  
Even though the tech is old now, the projects still show the type of real, hands-on automation work I used to do every day.

## 1. Overstock Listing Automation (Excel VBA)
**File:** `Overstock-Master.xlsm`

This tool was made to help with preparing and cleaning product data before uploading it to Overstock.  
It has two main sheets — *MAIN* and *Editor*.  

### What it did:
- Took raw product data and converted it into Overstock’s required format  
- Mapped attributes into the correct fields  
- Cleaned text, removed errors, and applied basic validations  
- Auto-filled large template sections that were usually done manually  
- Reduced a few hours of manual work into just a few minutes  

It’s a simple but practical workflow tool that saved our team a lot of time.

## 2. B&H Product Scraper (Excel VBA)
**File:** `BH-Scraper.xlsm`

This was a VBA-based scraper I built to extract product information from the B&H website.  

### What it did:
- Opened product pages using IE automation (very old method now)  
- Pulled details like title, specs, price, description, etc.  
- Parsed the HTML and placed everything into Excel  
- Prepared the scraped data for use in marketplace templates  

It wasn’t fast, but it worked reliably for the tasks we needed at that time.

## Why I'm Sharing These
These projects are part of my older portfolio.  
I’m keeping them here because:

- They show my early experience with automation  
- They were used in real work — not tutorials  
- They represent the kind of practical problem-solving I’ve done in eCommerce operations  

Today, I rebuild the same workflows using modern tech like **Python, Selenium/Playwright, and Pandas**, but these VBA tools were how I started automating things.
